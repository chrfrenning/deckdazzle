# DeckDazzle

DeckDazzle uses OpenAI GPT-4 and DALL-E to create a PowerPoint deck from a single keyword.

We made this to use in PowerPoint Karaoke settings, but can maybe be useful in other settings as well.

This is a work in progress, there's a lot to figure out, and we welcome contributions of any kind. Simply fork us and open PRs.
